Name: Horiseon Website

Description: This is a website for Horiseon. They do Search engine optimization, Online reputation management and Social media marketing. I refactored the html and css to make the website more accessible.

My motivation for this project was to make the Horiseon website accessible and leave it cleaner than I found it.
This website functions to show the viewer what Horiseon can do for their websites. Such as, Search engine optimization,
Online reputation management and Social media marketing.

Changes that I made:
I added an "id" to make the first link work correctly.
I cleaned up the CSS by consolidating selectors and organized them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
I added comments before each section of the html.
I changed the divs to semantic HTML elements.
I added "alt" attributes to all the images.
I changed the last h2 or h4.
I changed the title of the page to be more descriptive.
I added meta tags to optimize search engine searches.
